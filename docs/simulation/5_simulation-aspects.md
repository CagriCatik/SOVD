# Simulation Aspects
Mock ECUs and HPCs
To emulate real vehicle systems, the simulator includes mock Electronic Control Units (ECUs) and High-Performance Computers (HPCs). These mock components replicate the behavior and responses of actual hardware, providing a realistic diagnostic environment.

Features:

Configurable ECUs/HPCs: Define properties and behaviors to match different vehicle systems.
Simulated Communication: Emulate communication protocols and data exchanges between components.
Predefined Diagnostic Responses and Fault Scenarios
The simulator incorporates predefined diagnostic responses and fault scenarios to facilitate comprehensive testing. These scenarios mimic real-world issues, allowing users to validate diagnostic procedures and fault management strategies.

Features:

Response Templates: Standardized responses for common diagnostic requests.
Fault Injection: Introduce specific fault codes and scenarios to test diagnostic handling.
Graphical Interface
A user-friendly graphical interface, such as Swagger UI, is integrated to allow interactive API exploration and testing. This interface aids developers and testers in understanding and utilizing the simulatorâ€™s capabilities without needing deep technical knowledge of the API.

Features:

API Interaction: Execute API calls directly from the browser interface.
Documentation Access: View detailed descriptions of endpoints, parameters, and responses.
Testing Tools: Validate API functionalities in real-time.
