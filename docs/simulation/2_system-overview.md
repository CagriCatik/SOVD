# System Overview
The SOVD Simulator creates a virtual diagnostic environment that mirrors real-world vehicle diagnostics. It features a centralized gateway to manage diagnostic requests, a diagnostic manager to handle operations and fault management, and mock representations of ECUs and HPCs to simulate vehicle systems. Communication is facilitated through RESTful APIs using HTTP/JSON, supporting local, in-vehicle, and remote diagnostics.
