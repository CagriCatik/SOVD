# Core Features
RESTful API Design
The simulator adheres to REST principles, offering a resource-oriented API that enables seamless interaction with diagnostic data and operations. Resources are exposed through clear and consistent endpoints, facilitating intuitive access and manipulation.

Features:

HTTP Methods: Utilize standard methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for CRUD operations.
JSON Data Exchange: Employ JSON for data serialization and transmission.
Stateless Interactions: Ensure each request contains all necessary information for processing.
Data Operations
The API allows clients to perform a variety of diagnostic operations, including:

Read Diagnostic Data: Retrieve current diagnostic information from ECUs.
Write Diagnostic Data: Update configurations or settings on ECUs.
Execute Operations: Trigger specific diagnostic procedures or actions.
Manage Fault Memory: Access and modify fault codes and memory states.
Security and Authorization
Security is enforced using OAuth-based authorization, ensuring that only authenticated and authorized clients can access the simulatorâ€™s functionalities. This mechanism supports secure data transactions and protects sensitive diagnostic information.

Features:

OAuth 2.0: Implemented for secure token-based authentication.
Role-Based Access Control: Define roles and permissions for different client types.
Secure Data Transmission: Utilize HTTPS for encrypted communication.
Multi-Client Support
The simulator is designed to handle multiple clients simultaneously, allowing concurrent diagnostic sessions without interference. This is essential for environments where multiple testers or tools interact with the vehicle diagnostics system.

Data Access Modes
Support for both periodic and trigger-based data access enables flexible interaction patterns:

Periodic Access: Clients can request data at regular intervals, suitable for continuous monitoring.
Trigger-Based Access: Data access is initiated based on specific events or conditions, enabling responsive diagnostics.
Self-Describing API
The API is self-describing, adhering to OpenAPI specifications. This allows automatic generation of interactive documentation and facilitates easier integration with client tools.

Features:

OpenAPI Specification: Defines the API endpoints, request/response models, and authentication methods.
Interactive Documentation: Enables tools like Swagger UI to provide real-time API exploration and testing.
