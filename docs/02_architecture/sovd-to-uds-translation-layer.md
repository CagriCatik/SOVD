# SOVD-to-UDS Translation Layer

## Introduction to SOVD and UDS

**Service-Oriented Vehicle Diagnostics (SOVD)** represents a cutting-edge diagnostic framework tailored to meet the dynamic demands of modern connected vehicles and high-performance computing (HPC)-enabled automotive architectures. By leveraging a RESTful API built on HTTP/JSON protocols, SOVD facilitates seamless integration, dynamic diagnostics, software updates, and fault analysis across a myriad of vehicle systems. This approach promotes flexibility, scalability, and ease of use, aligning with contemporary software development paradigms.

In contrast, **Unified Diagnostic Services (UDS)**, standardized under ISO 14229, has long been the cornerstone protocol for diagnostics within traditional Electronic Control Units (ECUs). UDS operates on a static, byte-oriented communication model, which, while robust, lacks the flexibility and scalability inherent to modern diagnostic needs.

The **SOVD-to-UDS Translation Layer** serves as a critical bridge between these two paradigms. It enables seamless communication between state-of-the-art SOVD systems and legacy UDS-based ECUs, ensuring compatibility and scalability within heterogeneous vehicle architectures. This translation layer is essential for maintaining operational continuity and leveraging the strengths of both diagnostic frameworks.

## Functional Workflow

The **SOVD-to-UDS Translation Layer** operates through a series of well-defined functional workflows to ensure efficient and accurate diagnostics. Below is a detailed breakdown of these workflows:

### Handling SOVD Requests

1. **Receiving the Request**:
   - The process begins when a SOVD client sends a diagnostic request to the SOVD Gateway via an HTTP/JSON API.
   - The SOVD Gateway authenticates the request, ensuring it originates from a legitimate source.
   - Upon successful authentication, the Gateway identifies the requested URI and determines the appropriate internal pathway for processing.

2. **Interpreting the Request**:
   - The SOVD Gateway forwards the validated request to the Translation Engine.
   - The Translation Engine parses the JSON payload, extracting necessary parameters and determining the corresponding UDS service based on predefined mappings.
   - It translates high-level SOVD commands into low-level UDS service identifiers and structures the request accordingly.

3. **Executing the UDS Request**:
   - The Translation Engine dispatches the UDS command to the target ECU via the appropriate transport protocol (e.g., CAN, DoIP).
   - The ECU processes the UDS request, performing the requested diagnostic operation or service.
   - The ECU generates a UDS response, which is sent back through the transport medium to the Translation Engine.

### Generating SOVD Responses

1. **Processing ECU Response**:
   - The Translation Engine receives the UDS response from the ECU.
   - It interprets the byte-oriented UDS data, extracting relevant information such as Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs), sensor data, or status messages.
   - The extracted data is then mapped into structured JSON objects, aligning with the SOVD API specifications.

2. **Responding via SOVD**:
   - The Translation Engine forwards the JSON-formatted response to the SOVD Gateway.
   - The SOVD Gateway encapsulates the response within an HTTP/JSON framework and sends it back to the originating SOVD client.
   - The client receives the response in a user-friendly format, enabling easy interpretation and further actions if necessary.

This workflow ensures that diagnostic operations initiated through the modern SOVD framework are accurately translated and executed on legacy UDS-based ECUs, with responses seamlessly conveyed back to the clients.
